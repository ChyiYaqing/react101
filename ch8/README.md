### How to Handle Form Validation

A form can be as complex or as simple as required, but you'll use the pattern you see here no matter what form you build:

```
1. State values are used as the source of form data and validation
2. onChange prop are a way to update the state
3. Validations are triggered by user inputs
4. A handleSubmit() function is executed when the form is submitted.
```
